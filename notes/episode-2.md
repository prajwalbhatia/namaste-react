# npm vs npx
When we write `npm install`, it means we are downloading a package, but when we write `npx parcel`, that means we are executing a package.

## What parcel is doing?
- Dev build
- Local Server
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- File Watching Algorithm
- Image Optimization
- Minification of files
- Compress files
- Consistent file hashing
- Code splitting
- Differential Bundling (to provide support for older browsers)
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- Tree shaking

### So when we say React is fast, then a lot of things are done by different packages, from which parcel is one.
