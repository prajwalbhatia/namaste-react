# Types of routing
1) Server side routing - In this whenever we are changing the routes a new api call will be made to the backend to get that particular page.
2) Client side routing -  In this routing will be managed on the frontend side , no involvement of backend for getting the page on route change because we already have the page defined on the frontend.

# Single page application
Single page application means it will load initially once and after that whenever we are changing any route or navigating to one another page it will basically renders the new components according to the condition.
